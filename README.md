# SQL_Digital_Music_Store_Analysis
I'm thrilled to present my recent project DIGITAL MUSIC STORE ANALYSIS, where I utilized PostgreSQL to delve into a music playlist database and derive valuable business insights. This analysis aimed to help the music store understand its growth and make informed decisions. This project has significantly enhanced my deep knowledge and understanding of data analysis, SQL, and analytical approaches, solving hidden data problems effectively.

Tools and Technologies:

Microsoft Excel

PostgreSQL

âœ“** Analytical Approach:**

1. Comprehensive Data Analysis: Conducted an in-depth analysis of multiple data files to identify key metrics and trends.

2. Schema Design and Table Connectivity: Developed a robust schema and established relevant table connections to ensure data integrity and relational consistency.

3. Data Import and Database Creation: Efficiently imported the dataset into PostgreSQL and structured the database for optimal performance.

4. Formulation of Analytical Queries: Prepared and executed a series of targeted SQL queries to extract actionable insights.

5. Problem-Solving with Advanced SQL Techniques: Leveraged advanced SQL functions, including multiple joins, window functions, and Common Table  Expressions (CTEs), to solve complex data problems and uncover hidden patterns.

**Project Learnings and Skills Developed:**

Advanced Query Handling: Tackled a wide range of queries from beginner to advanced levels, enhancing my problem-solving skills.

- Insight Extraction: Extracted valuable insights by addressing specific business questions, facilitating data-driven decision-making.

- Optimization Techniques: Incorporated optimization strategies such as CTEs and efficient use of GROUP BY, ORDER BY', and aggregate functions ('SUM(), COUNT(), `MAX()') to improve query performance and result accuracy.

**Key Insights and Findings**:

Customer Consumption Patterns: Analyzed music consumption patterns to identify customer preferences and behaviors.
- Popularity Metrics: Identified the most popular genres, artists, and tracks.
- Geographical Insights: Discovered top-performing cities and countries based on purchase volumes and spending.
- Top Customer Analysis: Gathered detailed information about top customers based on invoice data and genre preferences.
- Track Popularity: Analyzed track lengths and their correlation with popularity, providing insights into customer preferences.
